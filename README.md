# Sentiment Analysis Model for Classic Film Reviews

Project Description:

Film Junky Union, a new community for classic film enthusiasts, is developing a system to filter and categorize movie reviews. Its main mission is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. You will use the IMBD movie review dataset with polarity labels to create a model that can classify reviews as positive and negative. This model must have an F1 score of at least 0.85.

Project Execution Steps:

- Load the data.
- Preprocess the data if necessary.
- Perform EDA and draw conclusions regarding class imbalances.
- Preprocess the data to build the model.
- Train at least three models on the existing training dataset.
- Test the models on the existing test dataset.
- Write some of your own reviews and classify them with all models.
- Check the differences between the model testing results from the two points above. Try to explain the findings.
- Present your discoveries.
